# Factors Associated with Medalling in Judo at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games

## Abstract
**Aim:** This study aimed to explore factors associated with medalling in judo at the 2020 Paralympic Games, focusing on age and technical and tactical variables. 

**Methods:** Using published competition results from the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, medalling outcomes for men and women were separately modelled using Bayesian penalised regression. Models considered athlete age and weight, sport class (i.e., B1, B2 and B3), throws per match, ground techniques per match, and penalties per match as fixed effects. Results are reported as the posterior probability that the effect was greater or less than zero (Prβ>0 or Prβ<0), depending on the direction of the effect.

**Results:** A total of 132 judo athletes with visual impairment (41.6% female) competed at the Paralympic Games. In the male competition, age (Prβ<0= .941), throws (Prβ>0= 1), groundwork (Prβ>0= 1) and penalties (Prβ>0= .959) per match were associated with medalling. In the female competition, throws (Prβ>0= 1), groundwork techniques (Prβ>0= .999) per match were associated with medalling; and there was weak evidence that age (Prβ>0= .840) and penalties (Prβ<0= .822) were also associated with medalling.

**Conclusion:** We found evidence that age, and technical and tactical variables were associated with medalling in judo at the 2020 Paralympic Games. Coaches, strength and conditioning personnel and athletes may consider these aspects in the long-term development of judo athletes. Future studies should consider whether the direction of the association between penalties and match success is different in male and female competition.
